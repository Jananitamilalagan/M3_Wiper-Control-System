# Introduction

A windscreen wiper or windshield wiper is a gadget used to eliminate downpour and flotsam and jetsam from a windscreen. Practically all engine vehicle, including trains, airplane and watercraft, are outfitted with such wipers, which are generally a fundamental prerequisite. A wiper for the most part comprises of an arm, turning toward one side and with a long elastic sharp edge connected to the next. The edge is swung to and fro over the glass, pushing water from its surface. The speed is ordinarily customizable, with a few constant paces and frequently at least one "intermittent"settings. Most automobilesuse two synchronized outspread sort arms. It takes a great deal of power to speed up the wiper sharp edges to and fro across the windshield so rapidly. To create this sort of power, a worm gear is utilized on the result of a little electric engine.

## COMPONENTS USED IN PROJECT:
# STM32F407G
STM32F407 series of microcontrollers are high-performance MCUs designed for medical, industrial and consumer applications. It is based on ARM Cortex-M4 and offers up to 168MHz. The STM32F407VGT6 is the onboard chip which comes in a 100-pin LQFP package.

The STM32F407G-DISC1 is a Discovery Kit allows users to easily develop applications with the STM32F407 high performance microcontrollers with ARM cortex-M4 32-bit core. It includes everything required either for beginners or for experienced users to get quickly started. Based on the STM32F407VGT6, it includes an ST-LINK/V2 or ST-LINK/V2-A embedded debug tool, two ST MEMS digital accelerometers, a digital microphone, one audio DAC with integrated class D speaker driver, LEDs and push buttons and an USB OTG micro-AB connector.

## Features Of STM32F407G
- Flash memory of up to 1 megabyte.

- OTP memory of 512 bytes.

- Compact Flash, SRAM, PSRAM, NOR, and NAND memories are supported by this flexible static memory controller.

- Sleep, Stop, and Standby modes are low-power modes.

- 16-stream DMA controller with FIFOs and burst support for general-purpose DMA.

- Up to 54 Mbytes/s 8- to 14-bit parallel camera interface.

- Generator of true random numbers.

- Hardware calendar, CRC calculating unit, 96-bit unique ID RTC, subsecond accuracy.

## SWOT- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities Threats:

# Strengths

- Agreeable, Easy to utilize, Fast and exactness activity.

- Easy handle and usage of features through a simple User Button.

# Weakness

- Limited usage Range.

- Timers/Interrupts can be a better approach instead using Delays.

# Opportunities

- It is a Advance System.

- Cost efficient.

- Since advanced features can increase Car value.


# Threat

- Need to be Very Careful While Using it

## 4W's and 1'H:
